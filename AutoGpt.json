Many entrepreneurs build entire businesses around these intangible goods, due to their popularity and ease of distribution, or launch digital products to sell complementary to the physical items or services they offer. Click here to start selling online now with Shopify What makes learning how to sell digital products especially appealing, however, is they can be created once and sold repeatedly to different customers without having to replenish inventory, making them ideal for creatives, bloggers, educators, and freelancers looking for passive ways to make money online that require less effort to maintain. Here's how to sell digital products online—including the top digital products examples, how to create your own, and marketing tips to sell online successfully. Find your next online digital products 💻 Quick start guide What are digital products? 6 profitable digital product ideas to sell online How to create digital products 8 apps for selling digital products on Shopify Sales and marketing tips for selling digital products Creating the best digital products for your business Digital products FAQ How to sell digital products in 4 steps 1. Find or create a digital product Unsplash Find a digital product to sell, whether you resell existing products or create your own. Digital products include music, fonts, Photoshop presets, courses, or online services. 2. Build an online store Unsplash Get up and running in a few hours. Pick from a catalog of website templates, populate with your logo, copy, and images, and you’re ready to get selling. 3. Use an app to make selling easy Unsplash Some apps make delivery of digital products even easier. Browse the Shopify App Store to find apps that plug into your store and do everything from hosting course content to delivering PDF purchases. 4. Market your digital products Unsplash Find your customers where they are. If you’re selling fonts or design templates, build an audience of designers and creators on the social platforms they use most. Consider influencer marketing, social ads, or lead magnets. What are digital products? A digital product is an intangible asset or piece of media that can be sold and distributed repeatedly online without the need to replenish inventory. These products often come in the form of downloadable or streamable digital files, such as MP3s, PDFs, videos, plug-ins, and templates. Why sell digital products versus physical goods? Selling digital products has many advantages that makes it uniquely attractive to entrepreneurs: Low overhead costs. You don’t have to hold inventory or incur any shipping charges. High profit margins. There’s no recurring cost of goods, so you retain the majority of your sales in profits. Calculate your profit margins ahead of time with our free tool. Potential to automate. Orders can be delivered instantly, letting you be relatively hands-off with fulfillment. Flexible products. You can offer free products to build your email list, monthly paid subscriptions for access to exclusive digital content, or licenses to use your digital products. You have a lot of options as to how you incorporate digital products into your business. E-learning is the future of education. You have a massive opportunity to expand your business and impact with e-learning, an industry expected to be worth $374 billion by 2026. But online digital products also come with specific challenges you’ll need to watch out for: You’re competing with free content. With digital goods, consumers can probably find free alternatives to what you’re selling. You’ll have to think carefully about the niche you target, the types of products you sell, and how to write your product descriptions. You’ll also want to offer high-quality products and know how to build your brand in order to compete. You’re susceptible to piracy/theft. You need to take precautions and reduce these risks by employing the right tools to protect your products. There are some restrictions on how to sell digital products. For example, you must sell physical products through the Facebook and Instagram sales channel according to their commerce policy. Most of these challenges can be overcome, however, if you employ the right tools when designing your digital product business.

Educational products Online courses are best suited for in-depth content. They require some effort up front, from creating a presentation to recording a video walk-through. When creating courses, start with learner outcomes: what do you want the learner to know or be able to do at the end of your course? You can include quizzes, knowledge checks, and interactive activities within your courses to help break-up learning content and make your e-course more engaging. Consider learning and implementing a teaching model like ADDIE. How to Cake It sells ebooks as an alternative to its physical cookbooks. If you consider yourself an expert on a particular topic, digital products are a great way to package that information and sell it to others looking to learn. If there’s an abundance of free blog posts or tutorials on YouTube about what you’d like to teach, you can compete by delivering content that promises not education but transformation. In other words, don’t sell the product—sell the customer’s own potential after buying your product. You can leverage an existing reputation as an expert to garner attention for your downloadable products to sell online or, if you’re starting from scratch, you can create and give away free content to generate interest and leads for your paid digital products. 2. Licenses to use your digital assets EditStock sells licenses for students to use its stock footage in their own demo reels. From stock photos to video footage, from music and sound effects, there’s a global ecosystem of licensable digital assets uploaded by creatives for other creatives to use in their work. By offering licenses to individuals and businesses, you can charge for the use of your photos, videos, music, software, and similar ​​top digital products in your own store and through online marketplaces, such as stock photo sites. In exchange for exposure, some of these marketplaces can take up to 50% in commission for every sale. However, if you want to build your own destination for digital products to sell, you can use SendOwl to power this type of business with unique auto-generated license keys. When coming up with assets to create, it helps to work backward from the needs of your intended audience. Start by thinking about what kind of assets they’d want to use in order to create products that are actually in demand (and thus easier to sell). Also, be sure to protect your digital products with watermarks and other security measures, especially if you’re selling photos.

Membership sites Snowboard Addiction offers a subscription for premium educational content to complement its physical products for snowboarders. Instead of focusing on how to sell digital products individually, you can bundle them together and lock them behind a paid subscription to generate recurring revenue. This approach to selling digital products is ideal if you plan to maintain a growing library of premium content and nurture a community of passionate members. In some cases, paid digital subscriptions can even create an opportunity to directly monetize your existing content marketing efforts. Since this content is behind a gate that only paying subscribers can access through their customer account, you can also host exclusive content that can be streamed rather than downloaded. You can build this type of business idea by using Subscriber Subscriptions for recurring subscription billing and Sky Pilot as your digital delivery system.

Digital products can also come in the form of intangible tools that equip professionals to do tasks that either fall outside of their skill set or take up a lot of time. You can sell digital solutions to the common pain points and needs of a specific audience. Some examples of ​​how to sell digital products online this way include: Digital marketing strategy templates for entrepreneurs Résumé templates for job-seekers Mobile apps for businesses Graphic design templates for brochures, flyers, posters, etc. Adobe Photoshop filters and plugins for media editors Icons, fonts, or UX Kits for web designers If you already have a freelance business, it might be worth considering how you can turn your skills and services into digital products to create passive streams of revenue. 5. Music or art Materia Collective sells digital sheet music for video game soundtracks. If you’re a musician or an artist, chances are you’ve explored ways you can monetize your talents or the audience you’re building. While print on demand t-shirts or custom prints are always an option, there are also plenty of digital product examples for selling art and music. A musician can sell ringtones of their best songs alongside their merch. Or a cartoonist could turn their art into printables, phone wallpapers, or print-on-demand products. A filmmaker can sell their movies online. Since you don’t have to hold any inventory with online digital products, you can experiment with different formats to see what your audience wants without much risk. 6. Services Street Parking packages its personal training programs into digital products to sell as a monthly subscription. Services tend to pair well with a variety of types of digital products because services are essentially their opposite—with services, your “inventory” is limited to the number of working hours you can accommodate. Plus, customers often receive digital products as part of their “purchase” with many services. A designer will deliver logos. A personal trainer might deliver a workout plan. Leaning into this, you can position certain services as packages containing valuable digital products. For example, you could offer a consultation for a fee, along with a personalized report or Excel spreadsheet, and then upsell your customers on your other services or products. Or you could offer a free downloadable product to generate leads for your email marketing list, a tactic that many online businesses employ today. If there are common tasks you complete as part of your service business that are easy for you but valuable to your customer, you can consider productizing them to create revenue streams that require less of your time and effort to maintain.

Get started How to create digital products While it’s easy to get stuck waiting around for a eureka moment, finding a good business idea is more of a process. It’s great to have an idea that excites you, but if you want an idea that sells, you’ll want to follow a process of brainstorming, research, and validation. Here’s what goes into creating the best digital content to sell: 1. Brainstorming Generate ideas to start with, and write them all down. Don’t be too critical—you don’t need to come up with the best digital products in your first brainstorm. Bad ideas can lead to good ideas and vice versa. The key to brainstorming is to avoid overthinking things. If you’re looking for a spark for ideas on downloadable products to sell online, here are some questions to ask yourself: Can you teach customers how to use your products? For example, if you sell knitting products, you could offer appointments to teach advanced knitting techniques. Are there things you can help your customers with related to your overall industry? If you sell surfboards, you could create a workout program to help your customers stay in surf shape at home. What are the values you’ve built your business on, and what are topics related to them? For example, if you sell sustainable apparel, you could create a course teaching your customers how to live a more sustainable life. In what ways could you bring your community of customers together? If you sell kitchen supplies, you could run a virtual guided wine tasting event. What are you good at? If you’re really great at product photography, you could teach other people how to get better at product photography too. Learn more: Finding Your Niche: 8 Niche Market Examples to Inspire You 2. Research Do some research to add to your list of business ideas. The best digital products to sell appeal to pain points your customers have related to your product, industry, or values, as well as topics they love or get excited about. Both present great business opportunities to provide value in the form of an educational product. Here are some good places to get started doing research for your top digital products: Facebook groups. There are Facebook groups dedicated to every niche and audience imaginable, making them a great place to learn what your potential customers care about. Industry forums. Forums dedicated to hobbies and communities in your industry can help you learn more about what people want and need in your broader industry. Product reviews. Read both the reviews for your products and competitors’ products to get ideas. These could come from the reviews on product pages as well as stand-alone reviews on blogs and other websites. Blog posts and comments. Read the blog content your community might be reading, as well as the comments, to get even more ideas. For example, if you sell auto parts, dig around on automotive blogs. Emails from customers. Finally, don’t forget to go back and reread any emails or messages you have gotten from customers over the years. The people who took the time to contact you with thoughts and concerns are usually “high intent” customers and they might have shared some really useful insights.

Validation Before committing too much time to your idea for digital products to sell, you want to validate it and make sure it’s solid. The last thing you want to do is invest a lot of time or money in a new venture without knowing it has a good chance to be successful. There are a couple of ways to validate your idea as you figure out how to sell digital products: Keyword research. Use a keyword tool to see how many people are searching for your topics. This will give you an idea of the opportunity size of each one. Google Trends. Search your topics on Google Trends. Look for topics that are growing in interest. This means the opportunity size will keep growing. Ask for feedback. Contact your customers directly, either through email or social media. A poll or survey is a great way to collect customer feedback. Start small and iterate. Sometimes, the easiest way to validate an idea is to experiment with a smaller version of the idea with room for growth. The goal is to get something out into the world as soon as possible so you can put your idea to the test and improve from it from there. No matter what industry you’re in, you have unique strengths and knowledge that would be valuable to your customers and selling digital products.

The first criteria for creating digital products is to add value to your customers’ life. Since you’re competing with free content on the web, invest in building a product people can’t find anywhere else. Promote a lead magnet. Regardless of how much your product costs, create a light version of it for free. A free product can help you build an email list you can sell to in the future. It also opens the door for upselling and retargeting potential customers with different promotions. Free builds trust between your business and potential customers. Start an affiliate program. Affiliates are a huge source of traffic and sales for creators selling digital products. Find influencers who are established and trusted in your industry and offer them a commission for each sale they make. You can create different percentages for different affiliates, so if someone has a massive audience, you can give them a higher commission rate to promote more and attract customers. Collect preorders. A great way to get early sales is by giving a discounted “early bird” price. If you’re releasing a new digital product, you can offer a 50% discount for the first 100 buyers, then 25% for the next 100 buyers, and then release the product at full price after the 25% discount runs out. You can only launch the 50% discount to your existing audience to reward their loyalty, get feedback, and drive prelaunch sales. Offer a money-back guarantee. If you’re hesitant about offering a warranty on your products, it makes sense. Some people could buy and use your product then ask for their money back. But it’s all a part of running an online business. The rewards of higher conversion rates outweigh the small percentage of people who may abuse the policy. A money back guarantee shows potential buyers you’re putting your money where your mouth is, and putting the risk on you, not them. Free Webinar: Marketing 101 Struggling to grow sales?
