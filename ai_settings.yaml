ai_goals:
- Do not use github or other online repositories. All data should be stored and retrieved from local text files. Do not write any code to accomplish the task.
- Parse the file online_business_ideas.txt to get a list of ideas for online businesses.
- For the next idea in online_business_ideas.txt, perform online research to gather data on what the business entails, what kind of virtual systems are needed to run the business and what a typical workflow for a business transaction would be.  GHT 3.5 should be used to summarize the information.
- After the research is complete, write a document containing three sections; Summary, Systems List and Workflow. For the Summary section, summarize what the business does. For the Systems List section, write a list of any virtual and/or physical systems required to run the business. For the Workflow section, create a list describing the workflow for each transaction, including all of the interactions between the clients, workers and virtual and physical systems. 
- Save the document to a local file. Keep track of which ideas have already been researched and do not repeat research for the same idea. After the document is saved, move on to the next idea.  Only use ideas that are in the file online_business_ideas.txt
